# Wireing

## How to wire the bot

Use 4 dupont 3-pin wires (think [these](https://3dprintingusa.com/products/male-dupont-to-female-dupont-3-pin-cable-70-cm?variant=15855423193131)) and connect the DIO data pins on the roboRIO to the corosponding pins on the RIOduino, particularly pins 2, 3, 4, & 5. 

Then wire the Adafruit_NeoPixel compatable LED strand to have pin 6 for the body LEDs, and pins 7 & 8 for the shooter LEDs.

And your done!
